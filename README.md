Hi and welcome to Projectopia my small GitHub and Oracle cloud learning center where I document all the projects I make for future employment or just for fun this website is my own resource that I hope I can pass some knowledge that I have to others there wont be super in depth tutorials or anything more like that I'm thinking more of the broad concepts of how I accomplished something I will provide pictures along the way to show you how it looks and I will make all of the project files I use open source like 3D models and scripts use them at your discretion though because I am still learning probably just like you and if something doesn't work I want YOU to try and troubleshoot and figure it out there wont always be someone to help you with things you could easily google or search for
